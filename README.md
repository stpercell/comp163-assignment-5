Assignment 5 work

-Critical thinking-

1,Why use a while loop instead of a for loop?
We use while loops when we want a lopp but don't know how many times we'd like it too loop. Therefore we make it condition. The code will stop whenever the condition we give it is no longer applicible.

2,Why use a for loop instead of a while loop?
We use for loops when we know exactly how many times we'd like something too loop. Meaning we do not need a condition or something to be true, we know exactlty what we want.

3,Why do you need nested loops? Which should be outer vs inner?
Nested loops are necessary when you need to repeat a process that is itself a repetition. The outer loop should be the one that is primary or controlling the secondary loop. The inner or secondary loop should be the more detailed one.

•	Why you chose each loop type for each challenge
For challenge one we used a while loop because we want whatever integer we put in to affect how it loops. So we can't control how much we want it too loop but we do want it to change based off whatever we put in.
For challenge two we use a for loop because we know exactly what we want to measure in the input statement. We know exactly what to do no matter what the input is. So only the for function could do that.
For challenge three we use a nested loop because we needed something to loop based off another loop. We also needed a nested loop for the format and to know how much to print out.
•	How your solutions work
My solutions were using lots of if statements. I kept getting stuck on mainly challenge three cause I didn't understand how to use it in a correect way without them. There are probably more efficient ways to do what I did but I used whatever tools I had at my disposal.
•	Any AI assistance used
As always I used chat gbt to understand where I was going wrong and I also used youtube to learn more about nested loops.
